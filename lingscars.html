<h1>This is a web page about Ling's Cars.</h1>

<p>There's not much here.</p>

<p>Just authenticity.</p>

<p><strong>And you're reading about it.</strong></p>

<p>We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p>

<p><strong>But the most powerful tool on the web is still being yourself.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote about this website, and you're reading it: <em>that's</em> magical.</p>

<p>I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else. I wrote this early in the morning, December 20th, 2023; you're reading it at a different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on your phone, a tablet or a desktop.</p>

<p>You and I have been able to connect because <em>I wrote this</em> and <em>you're reading it.</em> <strong>That's the web.</strong> Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect <em>here,</em> on a simple HTML page.</p>

<p>I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6 kB. I didn't need a Content Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's not much code on this page at all: just simple markup for paragraphs, hierarchy, and emphasis.</p>

<p>I remember discovering Ling's Cars website when I was younger. The first thing I noticed was the rainbow text and animated GIFs. It wasn't "bad web design"; <strong>it was pure, unfiltered personality.</strong> I couldn't believe that someone could create a website so unapologetically themselves, and then have the whole internet fall in love with it. I didn't care about the broken links; I cared about the human behind the screen.</p>

<p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>

<p>Think about all the things you could express with a simple page like this. If you're a businessperson, you could be genuine. If you're a designer, you could break the rules. If you're an artist, you could show your true colors. <strong>And if your personality is real, people will connect with it.</strong></p>

<p>If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about authenticity first. Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup, <em>start with who you really are.</em></p>

<p>What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding all that other cruft. <strong>Just start with one page</strong>, with a single focus. Write it and publish it, and then <em>iterate on that.</em> Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me be more genuine? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give my audience more of the real me? If the answer is "no," don't add it.</p>

<p><strong>At its heart, web design should be about authenticity.</strong> Authenticity doesn't come <em>after</em> the design is done. Authenticity is the beginning, the core, the focus.</p>

<p>Start with being yourself.</p>
