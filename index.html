<h1>This is a collection of web pages.</h1>

<p>There's not much here.</p>

<p>Just different takes on the same idea.</p>

<p><strong>And you're reading about them.</strong></p>

<p>We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p>

<p><strong>But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.</strong></p>

<p>Justin Jackson wrote these words, and you're reading them: <em>that's</em> magical.</p>

<p>Each page below takes Justin's original message about the power of words and adapts it to different themes and contexts. They all maintain the same minimalist philosophy while exploring new ideas.</p>

<p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>

<p>Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show something you've made. <strong>And if your words are good, people will read them.</strong></p>

<p>If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about the words first. Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup, <em>start with words on a page.</em></p>

<p>What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding all that other cruft. <strong>Just start with one page</strong>, with a single focus. Write it and publish it, and then <em>iterate on that.</em> Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give my audience more understanding? If the answer is "no," don't add it.</p>

<p><strong>At its heart, web design should be about words.</strong> Words don't come <em>after</em> the design is done. Words are the beginning, the core, the focus.</p>

<p>Start with words.</p>
