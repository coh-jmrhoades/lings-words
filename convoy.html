<h1>This is a web page about Convoy of Hope.</h1>

<p>There's not much here.</p>

<p>Just hope.</p>

<p><strong>And you're reading about it.</strong></p>

<p>We've become obsessed with fancy fundraising campaigns, complex donation platforms, and programs that do magical things.</p>

<p><strong>But the most powerful tool in humanitarian aid is still compassion.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote about this organization, and you're reading it: <em>that's</em> magical.</p>

<p>I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else. I wrote this early in the morning, December 20th, 2023; you're reading it at a different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on your phone, a tablet or a desktop.</p>

<p>You and I have been able to connect because <em>I wrote this</em> and <em>you're reading it.</em> <strong>That's the web.</strong> Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect <em>here,</em> on a simple HTML page.</p>

<p>I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6 kB. I didn't need a Content Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's not much code on this page at all: just simple markup for paragraphs, hierarchy, and emphasis.</p>

<p>I remember teaching my daughter about helping others when she was 8. The first thing she wanted to do was pack a box of food for families in need. She wasn't "doing charity work"; <strong>she was sharing hope with the world.</strong> She couldn't believe that she could help people she had never met, and then see the impact of her kindness. She didn't care about logistics; she cared about making a difference.</p>

<p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>

<p>Think about all the things you could do with a simple act of kindness like this. If you're a businessperson, you could donate something. If you're a teacher, you could inspire something. If you're an artist, you could create something meaningful. <strong>And if your actions are genuine, people will be helped.</strong></p>

<p>If you're a humanitarian worker, I challenge you to think about hope first. Instead of starting with a complex program or a fancy website, <em>start with simple acts of kindness.</em></p>

<p>What do you have to give? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding all that other complexity. <strong>Just start with one act of kindness</strong>, with a single focus. Do it and share it, and then <em>iterate on that.</em> Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me serve better? Will that additional program, donation, or volunteer opportunity give my community more hope? If the answer is "no," don't add it.</p>

<p><strong>At its heart, humanitarian work should be about hope.</strong> Hope doesn't come <em>after</em> the program is designed. Hope is the beginning, the core, the focus.</p>

<p>Start with hope.</p>
